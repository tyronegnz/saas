# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Tyrone Gonzalez

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? <mark>3

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |         <mark>    X      |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:


<mark> You must create a database for your program to use including at least one table to store data into.

<mark> Your software must demonstrate the ability to insert, modify, delete, and retrieve (or query) data.

<mark> This module requires more than just creating the database and determining SQL commands. You must write software that builds the SQL commands, submits them, receives the results from the database, and uses the results in some way.

Stretch Challenges (select one):


<mark> Add additional tables to your database and perform a join in your software between two of the tables.

<mark> Use at least two of the aggregate functions to summarize numerical data in your database.

<mark> Demonstrate the use of a column containing a date or time along with a query that demonstrates filtering within a date or time range.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

<mark>YouTube tutorials, official SQL Documentation.

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

<mark>Watch tutorials, read documentation, start implementation.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

<mark>Offer service as a software with the ability to make and edit notes and authenticate using Prisma as an ORM and PostgreSQL as a database.


4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

<mark>Each day of the week from 12:00pm - 2:00pm at the STC building.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

<mark>A technical risk could be having a scope to big for the sprint and a behavioral risk could be not having enough time due to my other classes.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: https://github.com/tyronegnz/saas/tree/master

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: https://youtu.be/FcuS17qkY5Q

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|

|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|    Yes    |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |    Yes    |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |    Yes    |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |    Yes    |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge. <mark>Added theme selection in settings

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it. <mark>No

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module: <mark> 10 hrs

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|        10 hrs           |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint. <mark>The project ended up being a bigger scope than what I originally tought it would be. Tackling it by sections and having time to dedicate to it has helped me.
